# TLM Nimble V6 Bracket

Zesty Technology designed a [Nimble](https://zestytechnology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nimble/index.html) mounting [bracket](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2701541) for [Tevo](https://tevo3dprinterstore.com) Little Monster 3D printers with the stock effector and hotend. This is an update for effectors with the [E3D V6](https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/Guide/V6+Assembly/6) + [Volcano](https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/Guide/Building+a+new+Volcano/9) hotend.

## Summary of changes

1. Enlarged the through-hole to allow the PTFE feed tube to pass
  - Otherwise, the filament would be free to bend/kink in the 10 mm gap between bottom of the Nimble and the top of the V6.
1. Removed material that blocked the tube collet and collet clip
  - Otherwise, the bracket would not sit flush on the effector.
1. Deepened the Nimble bolt countersinks
  - Otherwise, the bolts would strike the bottom and split the bracket in two during installation.
1. Lowered the surface for the effector mounting holes
  - Purely cosmetic, and allows for shorter mounting bolts when attaching the bracket to the effector in trade for printing some equivalent support material.

## Size: 1.75 mm filament models

E3D has both 1.75 mm and 3 mm sized models of their V6 hotend, and this bracket has been designed for the 1.75 mm variants.

If you have a 3 mm V6 and want to use the Nimble with your TLM, open an issue!
